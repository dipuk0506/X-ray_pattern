## Domain Generalization of X-ray Diagnosis through Identification of Irrelevant Patterns

X-ray images are often taken, preserved, and transported through adverse circumstances in less-developed countries. As a result, many X-ray images contain noises. In this paper, we propose an extra class that contains potential unwanted patterns during the training phase. Firstly, we observe images and crop the unnecessary portion of images that may influence the training. Then, we develop a class containing those cropped irrelevant patterns. Finally, we train vision transformer (ViT) and WideResNet models considering considering three classes: 1) Opacity (Diseased), 2) None (Healthy), and 3) Irrelevant Pattern. Our proposed approach improves generalization and provides higher accuracy than the traditional counterpart. We apply the proposed method to CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to judge the effectiveness of the proposed method. We received near state-of-the-art (SoTA) performances on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets while using the proposed method with the ViT-L/16 model. After the verification, we apply the proposed method to the chest X-ray (CXR) dataset. We statistically got better performance with the proposed method compared to the counterpart for all of the investigated combinations.
